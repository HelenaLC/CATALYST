\title{Compensate CyTOF data}
\usage{
compCytof(
  x,
  sm = NULL,
  method = c("nnls", "flow"),
  assay = "counts",
  overwrite = TRUE,
  transform = TRUE,
  cofactor = NULL,
  isotope_list = CATALYST::isotope_list
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \code{\link[SingleCellExperiment]{SingleCellExperiment}} 
OR a character string specifying the location of 
FCS files that should be compensates.}

\item{sm}{a spillover matrix.}

\item{method}{\code{"flow"} or \code{"nnls"}.}

\item{assay}{character string specifying which assay data to use; 
should be one of \code{assayNames(x)} and correspond to count-like data, 
as linearity assumptions underlying compensation won't hold otherwise.}

\item{overwrite}{logical; should the specified \code{assay} slot 
(and \code{exprs}, when \code{transform = TRUE}) be overwritten 
with the compensated data? If \code{FALSE}, compensated counts 
(and expressions, if \code{transform = TRUE}) will be stored in 
assay(s) \code{compcounts/exprs}, respectively.}

\item{transform}{logical; should normalized counts be 
arcsinh-transformed with the specified \code{cofactor}(s)?}

\item{cofactor}{numeric cofactor(s) to use for optional 
arcsinh-transformation when \code{transform = TRUE};
single value or a vector with channels as names.
If NULL, \code{compCytof} will try and access the cofactor(s)
stored in \code{int_metadata(x)}, thus re-using the same 
transformation applied previously.}

\item{isotope_list}{named list. Used to validate the input spillover matrix.
Names should be metals; list elements numeric vectors of their isotopes.
See \code{\link{isotope_list}} for the list of isotopes used by default.}
}
\value{
Compensates the input \code{\link{flowFrame}} or, 
if \code{x} is a character string, all FCS files in the specified location.
}
\description{
Compensates a mass spectrometry based experiment using a
provided spillover matrix & assuming a linear spillover in the experiment.
}
\details{
If the spillover matrix (SM) does not contain the same set of columns as 
the input experiment, it will be adapted according to the following rules:
\enumerate{
\item{columns present in the SM but not in the input data 
will be removed from it}
\item{non-metal columns present in the input but not in the SM 
will be added such that they do neither receive nor cause spill}
\item{metal columns that have the same mass as a channel present in the SM 
will receive (but not emit) spillover according to that channel}
\item{if an added channel could potentially receive spillover (as it has 
+/-1M or +16M of, or is of the same metal type as another channel measured), 
a warning will be issued as there could be spillover interactions that have
been missed and may lead to faulty compensation}}

\examples{
# deconvolute single-stained control samples
data(ss_exp)
sce <- prepData(ss_exp)
bc_ms <- c(139, 141:156, 158:176)
sce <- assignPrelim(sce, bc_ms)
sce <- applyCutoffs(estCutoffs(sce))

# estimate spillover matrix 
sce <- computeSpillmat(sce)

# compensate & store compensated data in separate assays
sce <- compCytof(sce, overwrite = FALSE)
assayNames(sce)

# biscatter before vs. after compensation
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
i <- "Dy162Di"; j <- "Dy163Di"
for (a in c("exprs", "compexprs")) {
  es <- assay(sce, a)
  plot(es[i, ], es[j, ], main = a, xlab = i, ylab = j, cex = 0.2, pch = 19)
