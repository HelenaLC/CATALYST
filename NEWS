=========================
  *** Version 1.4.0 ***
-------------------------

CATALYST now provides a series of visualization tools 
for differential analysis. These have been adapted from 

  Nowicka M, Krieg C, Weber LM et al.

       "CyTOF workflow: differential discovery in
  high-throughput high-dimensional cytometry datasets"

  F1000Research 2017, 6:748 (doi: 10.12688/f1000research.11622.2)

and may be used in conjunction with

  Weber L (2018) 

  "diffcyt: differential discovery in high-dimensional 
        cytometry via high-resolution clustering" 

  R package version 0.99.11, https://github.com/lmweber/diffcyt

--------------------------------------------------

o Data returned by & used throughout differential analysis
  are held in objects of the 'daFrame-class'

o The following functions are newly available:

  - plotCounts(), plotMDS(), plotExprs(), plotMedsExprs():
      > general overview of data features

  - plotNRS(): 
      > non-redundancy scores

  - tSNE(), plotSNE():
      > run & visualize t-SNE

  - cluster(), mergeClusters():
      > FlowSOM clustering, ConsensusClusterPlus 
        meta-clustering, and manual cluster merging

  - plotCodes():
      > PCA & t-SNE of SOM codes 
    
  - plotAbundances():
      > relative cluster abundances

  - plotClusterHeatmap(), plotDiffHeatmap()
      > ComplexHeatmap's summarizing clustering,
        meta-clustering & differential analysis results
