------------------------------------ 1.10.4 ------------------- Bioc 3.11, R 4.0

o The daFrame class been removed and the preprocessing pipeline 
  rewritten to use the SingleCellExperiment class instead. 
  This greatly improves runtimes of debarcoding and normalization,
  and affects all functions associated with preprocessing:
  - normalization: normCytof()
  - debarcoding: assignPrelim(), est/applyCutoffs(), plotEvents/Yields()
  - compensation: computeSpillmat(), compCytof(), plotSpillmat()

o concatFCS() has been replaced by prepData(), which is used during 
  differential analysis and already provided most of concatFCS()'s 
  functionality. It has been adapted to 
  - not require input panel and metadata tables (arguments 'panel' and 'md')
  - fix event times in the Time channel as was done previously by concatFCS() 
  - reorder samples according to their acquisiton time when 'md' is unspecified
  
o sce2fcs() has been added to allow for easy conversion from SCE 
  to flowFrame/Set, which can inturn be written to FCS file(s)
  - the SCE can be split into separate frames by a cell metadata variable 
    (argument 'split_by') to, e.g., write debarcoded samples to separate files
  - any cell metadata and dimensionality reductions stored in the SCE can be 
    optionally included in the output (arguments 'keep_cd' and 'keep_dr')
    
o plotScatter() has been added to support basic visualization of biscatters,
  but is not meant to compete with other tools available that were designed
  specifically for this task (namely, ggcyto)
  - cells my be colored by 
    - density, in which case cells are binned via geom_hex()
    - a continuous or categorical cell metadata variable
  - facetting is flexible and allows to plot 
    - one channel against a set of others
    - a pair of channels split by two variables
    - one channel against others split by one variable

DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS

o The metadata()$experiment_info slot is constructed by prepData() and 
  subsetted by filterSCE() as before. However, it is no longer required 
  for any of the plotting functions associate with differential analysis. 
  Instead, these rely only on the existence of the colData()$sample_id
  (and, for some, colData()$cluster_id) slot(s).
  
o added options for customizing visualizations, e.g., providing custom 
  color palettes for heatmaps and clusters, turning on/off row/column
  clustering and dendrograms in heatmaps etc.
  
o plotCounts() previously only supported plotting absolute cell counts by 
  sample and now allows to i) plot relative abundances (frequencies) instead;
  and, ii) group cell counts/frequencies by an addition cell metadata variable 
  (e.g., to plot abundances split by both sample and patient ID)
  
o The vignette has been extended to include sections on how
  - ggplot2 & ComplexHeatmap visualizations 
    can be customized or modified in retrospect
  - any clustering algorithms other than FlowSOM can be applied and 
    incorporated to make use of the visualizations available in CATALYST
  
------------------------------------ 1.10.3 ------------------------------------

o filterSCE() now drops non-existent levels in metadata()$experiment_info

  
o plotNRS() no-longer fails when samples have an insufficient number of cells;
  added check.names = FALSE in data.frame() to prevent renaming of antigens

o any mention of the daFrame class has been replaced by SingleCellExperiment
  in all function documentation and the differential analysis vignette
