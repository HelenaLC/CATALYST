Description: 
	CATALYST provides tools for preprocessing of and differential discovery
	in cytometry data such as FACS, CyTOF, and IMC. Preprocessing includes
	i) normalization using bead standards, ii) single-cell deconvolution,
	and iii) bead-based compensation.
	For differential discovery, the package provides a number of convenient
	functions for data processing (e.g., clustering, dimension reduction),
	as well as a suite of visualizations for exploratory data analysis and
	exploration of results from differential abundance (DA) and state (DS)
	analysis in order to identify differences in composition and expression
	profiles at the subpopulation-level, respectively.
